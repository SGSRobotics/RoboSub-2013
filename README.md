Following a successful showing at the 2009 AUVSI RoboSub Competition, the St. George's Robotics Team has built a new autonomous underwater vehicle from scratch, which it is proud to enter into 2013 competition. The design of the robot is built around the general architecture of a dirigible airship; the main computer and batteries are located in a long cylindrical tube, with the "gondola" section of the robot housing the thrusters and propulsion system.

The sensors attached to the system include an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a compass, a pressure (depth) sensor, and a Hall effect sensor, which will work in coordination with a Dreamplug computer to control the movement and direction of the AUV.

Needless to say, the robot this year is merely a skeleton of what the team hopes to accomplish in the upcoming years; the plan for competition this year will be more of a learning experience to see what can be improved upon in the future, in terms of both hardware and software. This is also the first time competing in the RoboSub competition for all of the team members; regardless, despite the lack of experience, the team hopes to remain competitive in the field with this autonomous underwater vehicle, which has taken the team three years to meticulously build and put together.
